# 🎓 Prepmate — AI-Powered Career Guidance & Study Planning Platform

**Prepmate** is a behavioural-AI driven career guidance and preparation platform for Indian students after  
**Class 10, Class 12 (Science) and Class 12 (Commerce).**

Unlike traditional career quizzes, Prepmate does not ask *“Which career do you want?”*.  
It understands **how a student naturally thinks, works and learns** and then maps this behavioural profile to realistic academic and career pathways.

## 🚀 Why Prepmate?

Students often choose careers based on marks, peer pressure or trends.  
Prepmate helps students make **clear, realistic and psychologically aligned decisions** using AI-driven behavioural assessment.

Prepmate is a **decision-support system**, not a random career predictor.

  - tolerate deep learning and long preparation
- dynamically adapts questions to reduce uncertainty

Assessment tracks:
